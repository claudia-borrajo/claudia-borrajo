Her research during this time focused on the representation of marginalized social groups in Cuban literature during the 1990s. Claudia later earned her Master’s degree from the Autonomous University of Baja California (UABC) in Mexico, where her thesis on the social representations of Tijuana in American cinema between 1930 and 1941 earned her an Honorable Mention Award.
